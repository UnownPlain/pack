## Installation

### MultiMC & Prism Launcher (auto-update)
  1. Download the instance [here](https://github.com/UnownPlain/pack/releases/tag/Modpack-Instances)
  2. Drag and drop the instance into the launcher 
  3. Click `Edit` -> `Settings` -> `Custom Commands`, then in the `Pre-lanuch command` field replace `{MCVERSION}` with one of these versions: 1.18.2, 1.19.4 and `{MODLOADER}` with fabric or quilt.
  4. When you first lanuch and the packwiz installer window comes up, click optional mods, select the ones you want and click ok
